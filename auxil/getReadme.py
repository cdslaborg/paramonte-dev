ParaMonte: Parallel Monte Carlo and Machine Learning
====================================================

ParaMonte is a serial/parallel library of Monte Carlo routines for sampling mathematical density functions of arbitrary dimensions and 
Machine Learning (ML) algorithms for scientific inference, with the design goal of unifying **automation** (of simulations and tasks),
**user-friendliness** (of algorithms), **accessibility** (from any platform or programming environment),
**high-performance** (at runtime), and **scalability** (across many parallel processors).

For more information on the installation, usage, and examples, visit https://www.cdslab.org/paramonte

ParaMonte Design Goals
======================

ParaMonte has been developed while bearing the following design goals in mind:

-   **Full automation** of Monte Carlo and Machine Learning simulations as much as possible to ensure user-friendliness
    of the library and minimal time investment requirements for building, running, and post-processing simulation models.

-   **Interoperability** of the core library with as many programming languages as currently possible,
    including C, C++, Fortran, MATLAB, and Python, with ongoing efforts to support other popular programming languages.

-   **High-Performance** meticulously-low-level library implementation to ensure the fastest-possible inferences.

-   **Parallelizability** of all simulations via shared-memory OpenMP threads and two-sided and one-sided 
    MPI/Coarray distributed communications while requiring zero-parallel-coding efforts by the user.

-   **Zero-dependence** on external libraries to ensure hassle-free ParaMonte library builds and ParaMonte simulation runs.

-   **Fully-deterministic reproducibility** and automatically-enabled restart functionality
    for all simulations with arbitrary digits of precision as requested by the user.

-   **Comprehensive reporting and post-processing** of simulations and ML tasks, as well as their automatic storage in
    external files to ensure the simulation results will be understandable and reproducible at any time in the foreseeable future.

    +   On **Windows** and **Linux** operating systems, we highly recommend downloading and installing the
        [Intel MPI runtime libraries](https://software.intel.com/en-us/mpi-library),

+   **Note**: Theoretically, you can use any C/C++ compiler on Windows to build and link your applications against the ParaMonte library.
    However, remember that the ParaMonte library example build scripts have only been tested with the GNU, Microsoft, and Intel C/C++ compilers.

+   **Note**: Theoretically, you can use any C/C++ compiler on macOS or Linux to build and link your applications against the ParaMonte library.
    However, as described below, the ParaMonte library example build scripts only recognize the Intel and GNU C/C++ compilers.

+   For the generic library build instructions, follow the guidelines provided in [install.md](../../install.md) in the root directory of the repository.

readme["examples"]["matlab"] = readme["examples"]["title"] + """
+   **Install a MATLAB >2017b distribution**, preferably, the latest MATLAB.
    The ParaMonte MATLAB library has been tested only with MATLAB version 2018b and newer.

+   **Optionally install a compatible MPI library** (or let the ParaMonte library take care of the MPI installation
    when you call the library for the first time). For parallel simulations (via MPI), you will need an MPI library
    already installed on your system. If you choose to install the library by yourself, we recommend the Intel MPI
    library, which is available for free from the Intel website or from [the ParaMonte GitHub release page](https://github.com/cdslaborg/paramonte/releases/tag/v1.5.1).
    On macOS, the OpenMPI (or MPICH) MPI library can be used instead of the Intel MPI library, which currently does not support macOS.

+   **Calling the ParaMonte library for the first time**
    +   Depending on your platform,
        +   **Windows**
            Nothing special needs to be done. You are all set! To call the ParaMonte library for the first time, follow the instructions below.
        +   **Linux/macOS**
            Open a `Bash` or `zsh` terminal and open MATLAB from the command line by calling its name,
            ```bash
            matlab
            ```
            If `matlab` is not recognized on your command line as an application, seek help from
            [this ParaMonte documentation page](https://www.cdslab.org/paramonte/generic/latest/troubleshooting/bash-matlab-command-not-found/).
    +   Once the MATLAB interactive environment opens, navigate to the root folder of the ParaMonte library (where the LICENSE file exists)
        and call the ParaMonte library for the first time via the following commands (simply type the commands on the MATLAB command prompt),
        ```matlab
        addpath(genpath("./"),"-begin"); % add the ParaMonte library directories to MATLAB's list of search paths.
        pm = paramonte(); % instantiate an object of class paramonte.
        pm.verify(); % verify the integrity of the ParaMonte library on your system.
        ```
        If needed, follow any extra instructions provided by the library on your MATLAB command prompt.
        **If you do not intend to run simulations in parallel, you can say NO (`n`) to any MPI library installation requests via ParaMonte**.
        If you do not intend to run simulations in parallel, answer YES (`y`) to any permission requests by
        the ParaMonte library to install the MPI libraries on your system.
+   **Running the ParaMonte simulations**
    For complete, up-to-date, detailed instructions, visit: https://www.cdslab.org/paramonte/generic/latest/run/matlab/
    +   Open the MATLAB software. On **Linux** and **macOS**, call the matlab executable from a Bash command line.
    +   The ParaMonte library typically ships with example scripts. If you see a file named `main.m` at the root directory of
        your ParaMonte library, then call this MATLAB script to run the example simulation provided by the library.
        If no such file exists, or if you intend to do simulations in parallel, then follow the rest of the instructions below.
    +   Suppose your mathematical objective function is a multivariate Normal distribution as implemented in this
        [logfunc.m](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cdslaborg/paramonte/main/example/mvn/MATLAB/logfunc.m) file.
    +   For **serial** simulations, download this example generic serial
        [main.m](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cdslaborg/paramonte/main/example/main.m)
        MATLAB main file and save it in the same folder containing the `logfunc.m` file you downloaded above.
        Then, type the name of this MATLAB main script, `main` on the MATLAB command prompt.
    +   For **parallel** simulations, download this example generic parallel
        [main_mpi.m](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cdslaborg/paramonte/main/example/main_mpi.m) MATLAB main file and save it in the same folder containing the `logfunc.m` file that you downloaded above.
        Then, invoke the MPI launcher followed by the name of the MATLAB main script on a
        MATLAB-aware MPI-aware Windows or Bash command prompt, similar to the following,
        +   on **Windows** (preferably, on an Intel Parallel Studio command prompt or, the Microsoft Visual Studio's command prompt or,
            some other command prompt that recognizes both `matlab` and the Intel's `mpiexec` software),
            ```
            mpiexec -localonly -n 3 matlab -batch main_mpi
            ```
            where the `-localonly` flag is needed only if you are using the Intel MPI runtime libraries
            (which is the default MPI library used to build the ParaMonte libraries on Windows).
        +   on **Linux** or **macOS** (within a Bash terminal),
            ```
            mpiexec -n 3 matlab -batch main_mpi
            ```
        Here, the parallel simulations are performed on three processes. Change the number 3 to any number of processes you wish to use,
        but do not exceed the maximum number of physical processes available on your system. Otherwise, it will only degrade
        the performance of your parallel simulations. For example, if you run the parallel simulation on a personal
        quad-core laptop, set the number of processes to 3 or 4 at most.
    +   Enjoy the unification of simplicity, efficiency, and parallelism in Monte Carlo simulations!
    +   The ParaMonte library samplers are extremely versatile, with many adjustable input parameters.
