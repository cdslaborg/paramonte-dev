ParaMonte: Parallel Monte Carlo and Machine Learning
====================================================

ParaMonte is a serial/parallel library of Monte Carlo routines for sampling mathematical density functions of arbitrary dimensions and 
Machine Learning (ML) algorithms for scientific inference, with the design goal of unifying **automation** (of simulations and tasks),
**user-friendliness** (of algorithms), **accessibility** (from any platform or programming environment),
**high-performance** (at runtime), and **scalability** (across many parallel processors).

For more information on the installation, usage, and examples, visit https://www.cdslab.org/paramonte

ParaMonte Design Goals
======================

ParaMonte has been developed while bearing the following design goals in mind:

-   **Full automation** of Monte Carlo and Machine Learning simulations as much as possible to ensure user-friendliness
    of the library and minimal time investment requirements for building, running, and post-processing simulation models.

-   **Interoperability** of the core library with as many programming languages as currently possible,
    including C, C++, Fortran, MATLAB, and Python, with ongoing efforts to support other popular programming languages.

-   **High-Performance** meticulously-low-level library implementation to ensure the fastest-possible inferences.

-   **Parallelizability** of all simulations via shared-memory OpenMP threads and two-sided and one-sided 
    MPI/Coarray distributed communications while requiring zero-parallel-coding efforts by the user.

-   **Zero-dependence** on external libraries to ensure hassle-free ParaMonte library builds and ParaMonte simulation runs.

-   **Fully-deterministic reproducibility** and automatically-enabled restart functionality
    for all simulations with arbitrary digits of precision as requested by the user.

-   **Comprehensive reporting and post-processing** of simulations and ML tasks, as well as their automatic storage in
    external files to ensure the simulation results will be understandable and reproducible at any time in the foreseeable future.


Quick Start
===========

> The MATLAB branch of the latest release of ParaMonte is a work in progress.  
> While most library functionalities are already implemented, the library API remains unstable and subject to changes.  
> We encourage you to build the library from source on your system and test or use it and let us know any comments you may have.  
> Remember that the previous major release of ParaMonte MATLAB remains fully functional, albeit with entirely different API.  
> The following guidelines apply to the previous major release of [ParaMonte MATLAB](https://www.cdslab.org/paramonte/generic/1/installation/matlab/).  

For a quick start with some MATLAB Live Script examples, visit [this ParaMonte documentation page](https://www.cdslab.org/paramonte/generic/latest/examples/matlab/mlx/).
The corresponding example source files (the `*.mlx` files) can be downloaded from the [paramontex GitHub repository](https://github.com/cdslaborg/paramontex/tree/main/MATLAB/mlx),
a repository dedicated to the ParaMonte library examples.

The following example code samples a 4-dimensional MultiVariate Normal (MNV) distribution via the ParaDRAM sampler in serial mode,

```matlab
addpath(genpath("./"),"-begin") % change this path to the root directory of paramonte
pm = paramonte();
pmpd = pm.ParaDRAM();
getLogFunc = @(x) -0.5 * sum( x.^2 );
pmpd.runSampler ( 4 ... assume a 4-dimensional objective function
                , getLogFunc ...           the objective function
                );
```

To learn about the post-processing and visualization tools of the ParaMonte MATLAB library, visit [this documentation page](https://www.cdslab.org/paramonte/generic/latest/examples/matlab/mlx/).


Installation
============

+   **Windows**
    The latest release of the ParaMonte MATLAB library can be downloaded from the release page of the library's repository on GitHub:
    [https://github.com/cdslaborg/paramonte/releases/latest/](https://github.com/cdslaborg/paramonte/releases/latest/)

+   **Linux**
    The latest release of the ParaMonte MATLAB library can be downloaded from the release page of the library's repository on GitHub:
    [https://github.com/cdslaborg/paramonte/releases/latest/](https://github.com/cdslaborg/paramonte/releases/latest/)
    Alternatively, you can download the library to your local system directly by calling the `wget` Linux application from the command line,
    ```bash
    libname=libparamonte_matlab_linux_x64
    wget https://github.com/cdslaborg/paramonte/releases/latest/download/$libname.tar.gz
    tar xvzf $libname.tar.gz && cd $libname
    matlab # run matlab from the command line, then call the supplied "main" example script
    ```

+   **macOS (darwin)**
    We **strongly advise you** to download the ParaMonte library for macOS via the following commands in a `bash` / `zsh` terminal
    instead of downloading the library directly from the GitHub release page,
    ```bash
    libname=libparamonte_matlab_darwin_x64
    curl -OL https://github.com/cdslaborg/paramonte/releases/latest/download/$libname.tar.gz
    tar xvzf $libname.tar.gz && cd $libname
    matlab # run matlab from the command line, then call the supplied "main" example script
    ```


Dependencies
============

The serial version of the ParaMonte MATLAB library has **NO external library dependencies**. 
The MPI-parallel version requires an MPI runtime library. 
The new thread-based parallelism features of the ParaMonte MATLAB library require the MATLAB Parallel Toolbox. 
The MATLAB Parallel Toolbox is usually automatically shipped with MATLAB software. 


Parallelism
===========

The ParaMonte library relies on three independent parallelism paradigms for parallel applications:

1.  The Coarray parallelism (only available for select routines in the Fortran programming language).  
2.  The Message Passing Interface (MPI) standard for inter-processor distributed parallelism.  
    +   On **Windows** and **Linux** operating systems, we highly recommend downloading and installing the
        [Intel MPI runtime libraries](https://software.intel.com/en-us/mpi-library),
        which is available to the public free of charge. This requires the ParaMonte 
        library to be (or have been prebuilt) using the Intel compilers.
    +   On **macOS**, the Intel MPI library is not available. Therefore, we recommend installing either
        [Open-MPI](https://www.open-mpi.org/) or [MPICH](https://www.mpich.org/) MPI runtime libraries
        depending on the prebuilt version of the ParaMonte library that you have downloaded or
        the configuration with which you intend to build the library.

Read the [`install.md` installation instruction notes](install.md) to learn more about the library's optional parallel build configurations.<br>

For more information, visit [https://www.cdslab.org/paramonte/](https://www.cdslab.org/paramonte/).


Example Usage Instructions
==========================

+   **Install a MATLAB >2017b distribution**, preferably, the latest MATLAB.
    The ParaMonte MATLAB library has been tested only with MATLAB version 2018b and newer.

+   **Optionally install a compatible MPI library** (or let the ParaMonte library take care of the MPI installation
    when you call the library for the first time). For parallel simulations (via MPI), you will need an MPI library
    already installed on your system. If you choose to install the library by yourself, we recommend the Intel MPI
    library, which is available for free from the Intel website or from [the ParaMonte GitHub release page](https://github.com/cdslaborg/paramonte/releases/tag/v1.5.1).
    On macOS, the OpenMPI (or MPICH) MPI library can be used instead of the Intel MPI library, which currently does not support macOS.

+   **Calling the ParaMonte library for the first time**
    +   Depending on your platform,
        +   **Windows**
            Nothing special needs to be done. You are all set! To call the ParaMonte library for the first time, follow the instructions below.
        +   **Linux/macOS**
            Open a `Bash` or `zsh` terminal and open MATLAB from the command line by calling its name,
            ```bash
            matlab
            ```
            If `matlab` is not recognized on your command line as an application, seek help from
            [this ParaMonte documentation page](https://www.cdslab.org/paramonte/generic/latest/troubleshooting/bash-matlab-command-not-found/).
    +   Once the MATLAB interactive environment opens, navigate to the root folder of the ParaMonte library (where the LICENSE file exists)
        and call the ParaMonte library for the first time via the following commands (simply type the commands on the MATLAB command prompt),
        ```matlab
        addpath(genpath("./"),"-begin"); % add the ParaMonte library directories to MATLAB's list of search paths.
        pm = paramonte(); % instantiate an object of class paramonte.
        pm.verify(); % verify the integrity of the ParaMonte library on your system.
        ```
        If needed, follow any extra instructions provided by the library on your MATLAB command prompt.
        **If you do not intend to run simulations in parallel, you can say NO (`n`) to any MPI library installation requests via ParaMonte**.
        If you do not intend to run simulations in parallel, answer YES (`y`) to any permission requests by
        the ParaMonte library to install the MPI libraries on your system.
+   **Running the ParaMonte simulations**
    For complete, up-to-date, detailed instructions, visit: https://www.cdslab.org/paramonte/generic/latest/run/matlab/
    +   Open the MATLAB software. On **Linux** and **macOS**, call the matlab executable from a Bash command line.
    +   The ParaMonte library typically ships with example scripts. If you see a file named `main.m` at the root directory of
        your ParaMonte library, then call this MATLAB script to run the example simulation provided by the library.
        If no such file exists, or if you intend to do simulations in parallel, then follow the rest of the instructions below.
    +   Suppose your mathematical objective function is a multivariate Normal distribution as implemented in this
        [logfunc.m](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cdslaborg/paramonte/main/example/mvn/MATLAB/logfunc.m) file.
    +   For **serial** simulations, download this example generic serial
        [main.m](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cdslaborg/paramonte/main/example/main.m)
        MATLAB main file and save it in the same folder containing the `logfunc.m` file you downloaded above.
        Then, type the name of this MATLAB main script, `main` on the MATLAB command prompt.
    +   For **parallel** simulations, download this example generic parallel
        [main_mpi.m](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cdslaborg/paramonte/main/example/main_mpi.m) MATLAB main file and save it in the same folder containing the `logfunc.m` file that you downloaded above.
        Then, invoke the MPI launcher followed by the name of the MATLAB main script on a
        MATLAB-aware MPI-aware Windows or Bash command prompt, similar to the following,
        +   on **Windows** (preferably, on an Intel Parallel Studio command prompt or, the Microsoft Visual Studio's command prompt or,
            some other command prompt that recognizes both `matlab` and the Intel's `mpiexec` software),
            ```
            mpiexec -localonly -n 3 matlab -batch main_mpi
            ```
            where the `-localonly` flag is needed only if you are using the Intel MPI runtime libraries
            (which is the default MPI library used to build the ParaMonte libraries on Windows).
        +   on **Linux** or **macOS** (within a Bash terminal),
            ```
            mpiexec -n 3 matlab -batch main_mpi
            ```
        Here, the parallel simulations are performed on three processes. Change the number 3 to any number of processes you wish to use,
        but do not exceed the maximum number of physical processes available on your system. Otherwise, it will only degrade
        the performance of your parallel simulations. For example, if you run the parallel simulation on a personal
        quad-core laptop, set the number of processes to 3 or 4 at most.
    +   Enjoy the unification of simplicity, efficiency, and parallelism in Monte Carlo simulations!
    +   The ParaMonte library samplers are extremely versatile, with many adjustable input parameters.
